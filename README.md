# pico_raspberry_raycasting
a ray casting thing on a raspberry pi pico

it uses composite video based on [this repo](https://github.com/breakintoprogram/pico-mposite)<br>
it take input from a ps2 keyborad from my other pico repo<br>

there is still no _actual_ ray casting, but I'm planing to add it soon<br>
right now you can see the players pos relative to a box<br>
I want to change the way the map is made, making it grid based<br>
the code is messy and you know it!
